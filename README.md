# Elevate Labs – Cyber Security Internship | Task 1 🔐

This repository contains my work for **Task 1: Local Network Port Scanning** under the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship, supported by Skill India and Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India.

---

## 🎯 Task Objective

Perform a scan of the local network using **Nmap** to identify open ports and understand exposed services. This task helps in learning basic **network reconnaissance**, a critical part of ethical hacking and penetration testing.
